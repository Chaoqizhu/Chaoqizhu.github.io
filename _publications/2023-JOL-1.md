**This study introduces a new mechanism for intermediate nepheloid layer generation by gas eruptions in a hydrate-associated tank, expanding understanding of sedimentary processes in deep-sea environments.**

## Abstract
Knowledge of nepheloid layers is important to improve the understanding of physical, geological, and sedimentary processes from continental shelf to abyssal environments. We had not tried to study the nepheloid layers in a hydrate-associated tank until unexpected results occurred. Tank experimental results show that gas eruptions triggered intermediate nepheloid layers. Thus, we proposed a new mechanism of intermediate nepheloid layer generation by eruptions. The intermediate nepheloid layers were generated in uniform-density fluid, which indicated that stratified fluid is not a necessary condition for intermediate nepheloid layers. Sufficient space for advection and an oblique slope for detachment are the key ingredients for intermediate nepheloid layer generation by eruptions. Our experiments also offer a new experimental evidence for bottom nepheloid layer generation by earthquakes. Given the scale effects of laboratory experiment, it is important to determine whether submarine volcanic eruption or hydrate-associated venting causes intermediate nepheloid layer in the nature.
