**Suspended sediment dynamics in the Yellow River delta were analyzed using a time series approach, revealing significant interactions among wave, current, and sediment variables, with waves primarily shaping episodic sediment concentration changes.**

## Abstract
Sediment suspended in the Yellow River delta provides significant physical, geological, and biogeochemical information. A time series of waves, currents, turbidities, temperatures, and tide levels were measured over a 134-d period using a submarine deployed tripod. A static model (multiple linear regression) and a dynamic model (superposed saw-tooth model) were constructed to express the interactions among wave height, current velocity, and suspended sediment concentration. The results documented a high suspended sediment concentration in this area with a mean of 2.24â€‰g/L. A superposed saw-tooth model of suspended sediment concentration disturbed by waves and currents was developed. The shear stress results explained how episodic waves were responsible for the big saw-tooth shape and how currents accounted for the small saw-tooth shape.
