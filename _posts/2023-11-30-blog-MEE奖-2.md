The Marine Environmental Engineering Awards, established by the Journal of Marine Environmental Engineering (JMEE) and associated academic organizations in 2023, recognize outstanding contributions in marine environmental and engineering fields.

The awards include the Rising Star, Outstanding Young Researcher, and Lifetime Achievement categories. The Rising Star Award, an annual recognition, honors early-career researchers. The Outstanding Young Researcher Award is presented annually to biennially for mid-career excellence, and the Lifetime Achievement Award is a biennial to triennial honor for globally renowned figures.

For detailed award categories and nomination guidelines, please see the [official awards announcement](https://www.oldcitypublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/JMEEv11n2p93-94Awards-editorial.pdf).

The 2023 Marine Environmental Engineering Awards are jointly presented by JMEE, the Marine Engineering Geology Commission of IAEG (IAEG-C34), Task Group on Submarine Geohazards of IUGS (IUGS-TGSG), and Committee on Marine Geo-disaster and Geoenvironment of ICGdR (ICGdR-TC4). We hope more academic organizations join us inparticipating and collaborating in the Marine Environmental Engineering Awards.

We proudly present the 2023 award recipients:
