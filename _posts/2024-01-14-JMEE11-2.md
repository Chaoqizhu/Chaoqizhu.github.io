The latest issue of the Journal of Marine Environmental Engineering, Volume 11, Number 2, explores advanced topics such as interactions between deep-sea mining vehicles and marine sediments, the zoning of harmful algal blooms using GIS, and the impact of abiotic factors on estuarine ecosystems. I am delighted to inform you that JMEE (Volume 11, Number 2) has recently published an exceptional paper by Xuguang Chen, the deserving recipient of the 2023 Outstanding Young Researcher Award. As announced officially, we have highlighted the 2023 award recipients both on the JMEE website and within the editorial of the 11.2 issue. I am particularly thrilled to share that Xuguang Chen is prominently featured on the cover of the JMEE 11.2 issue as the cover figure. Furthermore, his award-winning paper is showcased in this edition, accentuating his distinction as the recipient of the 'Outstanding Young Researcher Award.' The publication includes a comprehensive award citation and a portrait on the first page.
